Hello, my name is Jack Hamond. I am a traditional Roman Catholic husband and father. I enjoy spending quality time with my family, smoking pipes and cigars, and reading good books. My temperment is a decent mix of choleric and sanguine. My confirmation saint is the Angelic Doctor, St. Thomas Aquinas. I go to Church at [St. Michael's Traditional Roman Catholic Church](https://stm-nd.sspx.org/) in Mandan, ND. To see what books I have read and have influenced me, go to [My Library](/library/); please keep in mind that it is a working list.
