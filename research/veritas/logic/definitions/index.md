* Epicheirema - polsyllogism containing in itself the reson validating a premise
* Dillema - a polysyllogism where the Major is a disjunctive, and the two minors are conditionals, each positing a different extreme, but yielding the same conclusion

* Demonstration - argumentation engendering science
                - a syllogism containing premises that are true, primary, immediate, proir to, better known than, and causes of the cl
