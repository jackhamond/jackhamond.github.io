# Library

  These are a list of books in my personal library. They are sorted by the [Library of Congress Classification](https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/). I have not read all of the books that I own. You can tell a lot about a person by their library. I do care to mention that many of the books are "bad" books written by modern philosophers such as Ren√© Descartes who I disagree with on many, many things.

## A-BD: General Works, Philosophy, Logic, Speculative Philosophy
