## A Religious Use of Taking Tobacco

Anonymous; 16th-century English

The Indian weed witherèd quite,  
Green at morn, cut down at night,  
Shows thy decay;  
All flesh is hay:  
Thus think, then drink tobacco.  

And when the smoke ascends on high,  
Think thou behold’st the vanity  
Of worldly stuff,  
Gone with a puff:  
Thus think, then drink tobacco.  

But when the pipe grows foul within,  
Think of thy soul defiled with sin,  
And that the fire  
Doth it require:  
Thus think, then drink tobacco.  

The ashes that are left behind  
May serve to put thee still in mind  
That into dust  
Return thou must:  
Thus think, then drink tobacco.
