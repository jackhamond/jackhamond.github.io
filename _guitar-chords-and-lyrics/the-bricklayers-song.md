# The Bricklayer's Song

<pre>
[Verse 1]  

G                               D                     G  
Dear Sir I write this note to you to tell you of my plight  
C                                G              D  
For at the time of writing it I'm not a pretty sight  
C               G                  D               Em  
My body is all black and blue, my face a deathly grey  
        G                 C            D            G  
And I write this note to say why I am not at work today  

[Verse 2]  

G                                            D               G  
While working on the fourteenth floor some bricks I had to clear  
C                           G                 D  
But tossing them down from such a height was not a good idea  
       C            G               D             Em  
The foreman wasn't very pleased he is an awkward sod  
         G            C                   D            G  
And he said I had to cart them down the ladders in me hod  

[Verse 3]  

G                                          D            G  
Well clearing all these bricks by hand it was so very slow  
         C                   G                D  
So I hoisted up a barrel and secured a rope below  
       C           G                 D            Em  
But in me haste to do the job, I was too blind to see  
         G               C                   D         G  
That a barrel full of building bricks was heavier than me  

[Verse 4]  

G                                   D               G  
And so when I untied the rope the barrel fell like lead  
       C                 G                 D  
And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead  
     C            G                   D      Em  
I shot up like a rocket, and to my dismay I found  
       G           C               D            G  
That halfway up I met the bloody barrel coming down  

[Verse 5]  

G                                 D                    G  
Well the barrel broke me shoulder as to the ground it sped  
     C                     G                    D  
And when I reached the top I banged the pulley with me head  
       C                 G                   D             Em  
But I clung on tightly numb with shock from this almighty blow  
            G                 C                       D              G  
While the barrel spilled out half its bricks some fourteen floors below  

[Verse 6]  

G                                       D             G  
When these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor  
    C                   G              D  
I then outweighed the barrel and so started down once more  
        C                  G           D                Em  
But I clung on tightly to the rope me body racked with pain  
      G            C                D           G  
And halfway down I met the bloody barrel once again  

[Verse 7]  

G                                        D                G  
Now the force of this collision halfway down the office block  
          C         G                D  
Caused multiple abrasions and a nasty case of shock  
        C                  G             D                  Em  
But I clung on tightly to the rope as I fell towards the ground  
        G             C                 D                    G  
And I landed on the broken bricks the barrel had scattered round.  

[Verse 8]  

G                                           D               G  
Now as I lay there on the ground I thought I'd passed the worst  
          C              G                    D  
But the barrel hit the pulley wheel and then the bottom burst  
    C                G                  D             Em  
A shower of bricks rained down on me I didn't have a hope  
      G                  C                         D          G  
As I lay there bleeding on the ground I let go of the bloody rope  

[Verse 9]  

G                                  D               G  
The barrel now being heavier so started down once more  
     C                  G            D  
It landed right across me as I lay there on the floor  
    C                G               D              Em  
It broke three ribs and my left arm and I can only say  
   G               C               D           G  
I hope you'll understand why I am not at work today
