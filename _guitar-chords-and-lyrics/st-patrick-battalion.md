[Verse 1]  

   C            C           F                    C  
My name is John Riley. I'll have your ear only a while.  
   F                   C               C          C/B        Am  
I left my dear home in Ireland. It was death, starvation or exile.  
    F             C           F              Am  
And when I got to America. It was my duty to go,  
C                  F                     G                       Am        Am/B  
Enter the army and slog across Texas. To join in the war against Mexico.  
           C                        C                 F                     C  
And it was there in the pueblos and hillsides. That I saw the mistake I had made.  
F                    C              C           C/B     Am  
Part of a conquering army. With the morals of a bayonet blade.  
          F                          C                    F                     
So in the midst of these poor, dying Catholics. Screaming children, the burning  
             Am  
stench of it all,  
  C                    F           G                    Am  
Myself and two hundred Irishmen. Decided to rise to the call...  

[Chorus 1]  

            F            C      G                      Am  
From Dublin City, to San Diego. We witnessed freedom denied  
      F                           C              G                     Am  
So we formed the Saint Patrick Battalion. And we fought on the Mexican side  
   F                           C              G                     Am      Am/B

We marched 'neath the green flag of Saint Patrick. Emblazoned with "Erin Go Bragh"  
F                            C              C             C/B    Am  
Bright with the harp and the shamrock. And "Libertad para Mexicana"  
F                      C         F                    Am  
Just fifty years after Wolftone. Five thousand miles away  
          C                     F              G                     Am  
The Yanks called us a Legion of Strangers. And they can talk as they may

            F            C      G                      Am

We fought them in Matamoros. While their volunteers were raping the nuns  
   F                  C         C            C/B        Am  
In Monterey and Cerro Gordo. We fought on as Ireland's sons  
            F                       C                     F                       Am  
We were the red-headed fighters for freedom. Amidst these brown-skinned women and men  
        C                      F              G                    Am  
Side by side we fought against tyranny. And I dare say we'd do it again

We fought them in five major battles. Churobusco was the last

Overwhelmed by the cannons from Boston. We fell after each mortar blast

Most of us died on that hillside. In the service of the Mexican state  
   C                     F                 G                     Am  
So far from our occupied homeland. We were heroes and victims of fate
