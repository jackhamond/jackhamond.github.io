# The Fields of Athenry

[Intro]
| A    | A    | D    | D    |

[Verse 1]
     D                     G                  D  A
By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young girl calling
D                  G          A
Michael, they have taken you away
        D                  G          D                    A
For you stole Trevelyan's corn so the young might see the morn'
      A                               D
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay

[Chorus]
D   G       D              Bm
Low lie the fields of Athenry
      D                                    A
where once we watched the small free birds fly
    D               G
Our love was on the wing
       D                   A
We had dreams and songs to sing
        A                A7             D
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

[Verse 2]
     D                     G                 D  A
By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling
D                G                 A
Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free
            D              G          D                   A
Against the famine and the crown, I rebelled, they cut me down
    A                                  D
Now you must raise our child with dignity

[Chorus]
D   G       D              Bm
Low lie the fields of Athenry
      D                                    A
where once we watched the small free birds fly
    D               G
Our love was on the wing
       D                   A
We had dreams and songs to sing
        A                A7             D
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

[Verse 3]
     D                        G                     D  A
By a lonely harbour wall, she watched the last star falling
       D                  G               A
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
          D                 G           D               A
For she'd live in hope and pray for her love in Botany Bay
        A                               D
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

[Chorus]
D   G       D              Bm
Low lie the fields of Athenry
      D                                    A
where once we watched the small free birds fly
    D               G
Our love was on the wing
       D                   A
We had dreams and songs to sing
        A                A7             D
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

D   G       D              Bm
Low lie the fields of Athenry
      D                                    A
where once we watched the small free birds fly
    D               G
Our love was on the wing
       D                   A
We had dreams and songs to sing
        A                A7             D   G   D
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
