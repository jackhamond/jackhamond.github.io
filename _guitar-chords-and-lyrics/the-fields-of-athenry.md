# The Fields of Athenry

[Intro]
| A    | A    | D    | D    |

[Verse 1]
G                          C                  G  D
By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young girl calling
G                  C          D
Michael, they have taken you away
        G                  C          G                    D
For you stole Trevelyan's corn so the young might see the morn'
      Am                              G
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay

[Chorus]
G   C       G              Em
Low lie the fields of Athenry
      G                                    D
where once we watched the small free birds fly
    G               C
Our love was on the wing
       G                   D
We had dreams and songs to sing
        Am               D             G
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

[Verse 2]
     G                     C                 G  D
By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling
G                C                 D
Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free
            G              C          G                   D
Against the famine and the crown, I rebelled, they cut me down
    Am                                 G
Now you must raise our child with dignity

[Chorus]
G   C       G              Em
Low lie the fields of Athenry
      G                                    D
where once we watched the small free birds fly
    G               C
Our love was on the wing
       G                   D
We had dreams and songs to sing
        Am               D             G
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

[Verse 3]
     G                        C                     G  D
By a lonely harbour wall, she watched the last star falling
       G                  C               D
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
          G                 C           G               D
For she'd live in hope and pray for her love in Botany Bay
        Am                              G
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

[Chorus]
G   C       G              Em
Low lie the fields of Athenry
      G                                    D
where once we watched the small free birds fly
    G               C
Our love was on the wing
       G                   D
We had dreams and songs to sing
        Am               D             G
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
