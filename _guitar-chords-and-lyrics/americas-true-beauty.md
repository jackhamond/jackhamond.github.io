# America's True Beauty

<pre>
[Verse 1]  

  G             D  
O beautiful for spacious skies,  
    D7             G  
for amber waves of grain  
                    D  
For purple mountain majesties,  
 A        A7      D    D7  
above the fruited plain!  

[Chorus]

 G        D  
America! America!  
    D7                G  
God shed his grace on thee  
      C                   G  
Crown Christ thy King and Mary Queen  
     C      D7      G  
from sea to shining sea!  

[Verse 2]  

     G             D  
More beautiful for Catholic names,  
      D7                   G  
Which claimed Thee for our King  
                  D  
For Masses read, and priests' blood shed,  
 A         A7    D   D7  
Which souls to heaven bring.  

[Chorus]

 G        D  
America! America!  
    D7                G  
God shed his grace on thee  
      C                   G  
Crown Christ thy King and Mary Queen  
     C      D7      G  
from sea to shining sea!  

[Verse 3]  

  G             D  
Immaculate, O Mother dear,  
   D7         G  
Protect our native land.  
                         D  
We consecrate our hearts to thee,  
    A     A7        D   D7  
Lest we have built on sand.  

[Chorus]

 G        D  
America! America!  
    D7                G  
God shed his grace on thee  
      C                   G  
Crown Christ thy King and Mary Queen  
     C      D7      G  
from sea to shining sea!
