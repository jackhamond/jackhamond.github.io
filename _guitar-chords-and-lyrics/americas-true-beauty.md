# America's True Beauty

<pre>
[Verse 1]  

  G             D  
O beautiful for spacious skies,  
    D7             G  
for amber waves of grain  
                    D  
For purple mountain majesties,  
 A        A7      D    D7  
above the fruited plain!  

[Chorus]

 G        D  
America! America!  
    D7                G  
God shed his grace on thee  
      C                   G  
Crown Christ thy King and Mary Queen  
     C      D7      G  
from sea to shining sea!  

[Verse 2]  

  G             D  
O beautiful for pilgrim feet,  
      D7                G  
whose stern impassioned stress  
                  D  
A thoroughfare of freedom beat,  
 A         A7    D   D7  
across the wilderness!  

[Chorus]

 G        D  
America! America!  
    D7                G  
God shed his grace on thee  
      C                   G  
Crown Christ thy King and Mary Queen  
     C      D7      G  
from sea to shining sea!  

[Verse 3]  

  G             D  
O beautiful for heroes proved,  
   D7         G  
in liberating strife.  
                         D  
Who more than self their country loved,  
    A     A7        D   D7  
and mercy more than life!  

[Chorus]

 G        D  
America! America!  
    D7                G  
God shed his grace on thee  
      C                   G  
Crown Christ thy King and Mary Queen  
     C      D7      G  
from sea to shining sea!
