Take the good and cast the evil,  
Listen, people, to my song,  
For ’tis God for whom I’m speaking  
To the valiant and the strong.  

Take the Cross, the Cross He died on,  
Oh, repay Him as ye may;  
For by dying He redeemed us—  
Can we give Him less today?  

Counts and princes they may spoil us,  
But their spoiling stays at death;  
What the treasures of their hoarding  
When they give their final breath?  

Better far to up and rally  
In the good cause I proclaim.  
Where at death are earthly honors?  
Lost forever, lost in shame.  

Cowards! spending time and labor  
For your bodies, for a wage;  
All shall pass and all shall wither—  
Soon the youth shall turn to age.  

But the guerdons of true virtue,  
Oh, they live forevermore!  
Oh, the bitterness of losing  
Of their everlasting store!  

He to whom the Light is given,  
He will up for Holy Land.  
At the Day of Judgment, scathless,  
Will the good from evil stand.  

When the world shall mighty tremble,  
Oh, that soul shall fearless be,  
Quailing never such before Him,  
Coming in His majesty!  

Help me, God, in this my pleading!  
Tardy have we been to free  
That Thy Cross and that Thy country  
Where the Infidels mock Thee.  

’Tis our sins that have delayed us,  
Let us cast them and be free,  
Leaving everything behind us,  
Finding Paradise with Thee.  

Such an one will all men honor,  
If returning God decrees—  
Sweet in absence is his country,  
Sweeter if once home he sees.  

Living still his lovely lady,  
As he left her, hardly won—  
Oh, he jousts for her sweet favor,  
Now his task for God is done.  

**Envoy**  
O my good knights, may God keep you,  
Whom I’ve loved so evermore,  
That in loving you I’ve almost  
Oft forgot my God of yore!
