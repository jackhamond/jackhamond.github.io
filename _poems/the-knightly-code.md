You who seek the knightly order  
Must begin your life anew;  
Watch and pray you most devoutly,  
Pride and wicked sin eschew;  

Protect the Church, the child, the widow,  
Strongly guard the people too;  
Valour, loyalty and virtue  
From a worthy knight are due.  

An humble heart and active body  
Chivalry of you demands;  
Fight you well and often journey  
O’er the seas to other lands;  

Joust you for the love of lady  
On the tilt-yard’s tawny sands;  
Tenderly protect your honor  
With your soul and with your hands.  

Love the lord who calls you vassal,   
Guard his fields from enemy;   
Liberality and justice Cherish;  
seek the company of other knights  

That, from their wisdom,  
Yours may grow to like degree; 
Thus' a knight like Alexander  
May you hope in time to be.
