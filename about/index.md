## Who Am I

Hello, my name is Jack Hamond. I am a traditional Roman Catholic husband and father. I enjoy spending quality time with my family, smoking pipes and cigars, and reading good books.

## Website Structure

Every so often I will publish a blog post in the [Blog](/blog/) section. The blog posts will be in the order of which I make them. When I do research on a subject, I publish something in the [Research](/reseach/) section will be more complete, organized, and coherent.
