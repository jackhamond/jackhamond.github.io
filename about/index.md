## Who Am I

Hello, my name is Jack Hamond. I am a traditional Roman Catholic husband and father. I enjoy spending quality time with my family, smoking pipes and cigars, and reading good books. My temperment is a decent mix of choleric and sanguine. My confirmation saint is the Angelic Doctor, St. Thomas Aquinas. I go to Church at [St. Michael's Traditional Roman Catholic Church](https://stm-nd.sspx.org/) in Mandan, ND. To see what books I have read and have influenced me, go to [My Library](/library/); please keep in mind that it is a working list. To see what book I am reading now, click on my [Reading Status].

## Website Structure

Every so often I will publish a blog post in the [Blog](/blog/) section. The blog posts will be in the order of which I make them. When I do research on a subject, I will publish to the [Research](/reseach/) section whhich will be more complete, organized, and coherent.

## Links

This website is my own, personal website. I have a professional website as well which is essentially an extended résumé. My professional website can be found at [https://jackhamondpro.github.io](https://jackhamondpro.github.io).
