  description: "The purpose of this site is to bring souls to the one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church -- the Church headed by Christ and built on the rock of St. Peter, the Church against which the gates of Hell will never prevail. FishEaters strives to do this by showing Protestants the errors of Protestantism and by teaching Catholics to recognize what is and isn't Catholic."
