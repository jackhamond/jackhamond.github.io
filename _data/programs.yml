- name: "w3m"
  note: "I used to use brave for everything I did on the internet. There are two reasons why I prefer to use w3m when possible. The first is that I don't have to leave the terminal. The second is that GUIs tend to be a place where I can easily get distracted; I would go to brave to look something up and 45 minutes I would realize I got distracted. w3m uses vim-style bindings."
