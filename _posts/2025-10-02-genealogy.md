# My Genealogy

My great-great-grandfather Pius Becker came from Germany. As far as we know he was 100% German. He had a farm in St. Michael's, MN. One of his sons, Roman Becker, was my great-grandfather. My grandmother said they moved when she was four years old to a 210 acre farm in Albertville, MN. They had 40 milk cows and would get some beef cattle for themselves (two a year). They grew corn, alfalfa, and wheat. They made silage. They had 500 laying hens. A milk man, an egg man, a tool man and even a worm lady would come.
