  “There was once a time when the Church stood at the center of every city, and Christ was King not just in name but in law and life, there were men called knights. They fasted before battle. They kept vigil in chapels with their swords laid across the altar. They stood before bishops who gave them not just a sword—but a mission: **To defend the weak. To fight for the Church. To live as Christian soldiers.** …”

# The Knight is Forged at Home

## The Call of the Trumpet

What is a knight? One may think of a knight as a man in armor with a sword in one hand and a shield in the other, but this is only what a knight wears—it does not tell you what a knight is. Who is the man in the armor and why does he have a sword and shield? What makes him a knight? Who has made him a knight? What is his reason for being a knight?

When the Church stood at the center of every city, and Christ was King not just in name but in law and life, there were men called knights. They fasted before battle. They kept vigil in chapels with their swords laid across the altar. They stood before bishops who gave them not just a sword—but a mission: **To defend the weak. To fight for the Church. To live as Christian soldiers.**

At the imposition of the sword that was given at a knighting ceremony that you could find in the Roman Pontifical up until 1962 the bishop would say: Receive this sword, in the name of the + Father and of the + Son, and of the + Holy Ghost. Use it for thine own defense and for the defense of Holy Mother Church, and to the confounding of the enemies of the Cross of Christ and the Christian faith, and inasmuch as our human frailty permits, may you never unjustly strike any man. May Our Lord deign to grant you this, who lives with the Father and the Holy Ghost, world without end. Amen.

In situations where a knight was made with the proper preparation, the actual knighting ceremony was preceded by a three day fast. The knightly code was contained in what is commonly known as the Ten Commandments of Chivalry. The Ten Commandments of Chivalry are:  

1. Thou shalt believe all that the Church teaches and shalt observe all its directions.  
1. Thou shalt defend the Church.
1. Thou shalt respect all weaknesses, and shalt constitute thyself the defender of them.  
1. Thou shalt love the country in which thou wast born.  
1. Thou shalt not recoil before thine enemy.  
1. Thou shalt make war against the infidel without cessation and without mercy.  
1. Thou shalt perform scrupulously thy feudal duties, if they be not contrary to the laws of God.  
1. Thou shalt never lie, and shalt remain faithful to thy pledged word.  
1. Thou shalt be generous, and give largesse to everyone.  
1. Thou shalt be everywhere and always the champion of the Right and the Good against Injustice and Evil.

## The Knight


## The Forge — Home and Family

A knight is not born ready for battle.
He is forged.

Like steel in fire, he is heated, shaped, and tested.
Where? At home.

The home is the first kingdom a boy learns to guard.
It is the chapel, the castle, and the forge—all at once.

Your parents are not just there to feed and clothe you.
They are the ones God has placed over the anvil.
They teach you how to pray.
They correct you when you fall.
They hand you little crosses—so that one day, you can carry a greater one.

A boy who will not obey his mother will never lead men well.
A man who rolls his eyes at his father’s words will not kneel before Christ.
A brother who is harsh with his sister will be a weak protector.

Training begins now.

Are you tired when your mother calls you to help? Help anyway.
Is your little sister annoying? Be patient and kind. She is learning to be a lady.
Does your father correct you? Thank him. He sees something in you worth fighting for.

These may seem like small things.
But a knight who cannot win at home will lose on the field.

When Our Lord was a boy, He obeyed.
The Gospels say it plainly: “He was subject to them.” (Luke 2:51)

If the Son of God could listen to Mary and Joseph, so can you.
And if you do—if you keep going—then slowly, silently, the forge will do its work.

Your soul will grow straight and strong.
