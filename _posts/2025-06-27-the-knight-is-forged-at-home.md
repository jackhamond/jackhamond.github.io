  “There was once a time when the Church stood at the center of every city, and Christ was King not just in name but in law and life, there were men called knights. They fasted before battle. They kept vigil in chapels with their swords laid across the altar. They stood before bishops who gave them not just a sword—but a mission: **To defend the weak. To fight for the Church. To live as Christian soldiers.** …”

# The Knight is Forged at Home
*A Letter to the Boys and Young Men of the Parish*

> "Chivalry is the Christian form of the military profession: the knight is the Christian soldier."
> — *Dom Gérard Calvet*

## Beyond the Armour

What is a knight? One may think of a knight as a man in armour with a sword in one hand and a shield in the other, but this is only what a knight wears—it does not tell you what a knight is. Who is the man in the armour and why does he have a sword and shield? What makes him a knight? Who has made him a knight? What is his reason for being a knight?

When the Church stood at the center of every city, and Christ was King not just in name but in law and life, there were men called knights. They fasted before battle. They kept vigil in chapels with their swords laid across the altar. They stood before bishops who gave them not just a sword—but a mission: **To defend the weak. To fight for the Church. To live as Christian soldiers.**

## The Shape of the Knight

At the imposition of the sword that was given at a knighting ceremony that you could find in the Roman Pontifical up until 1962 the bishop would say: Receive this sword, in the name of the + Father and of the + Son, and of the + Holy Ghost. Use it for thine own defense and for the defense of Holy Mother Church, and to the confounding of the enemies of the Cross of Christ and the Christian faith, and inasmuch as our human frailty permits, may you never unjustly strike any man. May Our Lord deign to grant you this, who lives with the Father and the Holy Ghost, world without end. Amen.

In situations where a knight was made with the proper preparation, the actual knighting ceremony was preceded by a three day fast. The knightly code was contained in what is commonly known as the Ten Commandments of Chivalry. The Ten Commandments of Chivalry are:  

1. Thou shalt believe all that the Church teaches and shalt observe all its directions.  
1. Thou shalt defend the Church.
1. Thou shalt respect all weaknesses, and shalt constitute thyself the defender of them.  
1. Thou shalt love the country in which thou wast born.  
1. Thou shalt not recoil before thine enemy.  
1. Thou shalt make war against the infidel without cessation and without mercy.  
1. Thou shalt perform scrupulously thy feudal duties, if they be not contrary to the laws of God.  
1. Thou shalt never lie, and shalt remain faithful to thy pledged word.  
1. Thou shalt be generous, and give largesse to everyone.  
1. Thou shalt be everywhere and always the champion of the Right and the Good against Injustice and Evil.

## The Knight is Forged at Home

I believe that there are many ways that we can embody the spirit of the knight and it begins at home. A boy who will not obey his mother will never lead men well. A man who rolls his eyes at his father’s words will not kneel before Christ. A brother who is harsh with his sister will be a weak protector. Being a knight requires one to give their life for God.

Although we cannot become a knight in the medieval sense with a sword and shield, armour, and ceremony, we can and must strive after the principles of the knight. 

In his masterpiece *La Chevalerie* [Chivarly], Léon Gautier describes the life of a knight: his birth, Baptism, childhood, education, knighthood, espousals, and domestic and military life.

> When a noble child was very young, his mother taught him his prayer. His formal education began at seven years of age. The religious instruction generally did not consist of a special course, since all the acts of the young knight were stamped with Christian ideals.  
> Moral instruction came from the lips of all those who surrounded the young baron, and he assimilated all this naturally – instructions on politeness, deportment and good manners. They can be summed up in one word: courtesy.  
> Both the mother and the father of the future knight were deeply involved in teaching the young baron lessons in courtesy.  
> “It is always best to begin with God,” his mother would say. “In the difficult hours of your life, remember that He will never desert you if you put your trust in Him. Remember the story of Aiol. His father Elie was exiled from France, disinherited, and sick, living in a miserable hovel. When the day came that Elie had to send his son to recover his territory, he could give him nothing but rusty armor, an old shield, and four pence. But he spoke these noble words, ‘Son, if you lack anything - go to your Father in Heaven.’ And the child replied, ‘If we do not have enough here, God at least has plenty!’ That is the faith you must have in your heart.”  
> His father would tell him, “You must have confidence in God, but also you must also have justice on your side. Be assured, my child, that if you fight for God and for right, you will conquer.”  
> “Above all, be humble,” his mother would continue. “If you had 100 horses in your stables and all the wealth of the world, nothing would go well for you if pride possessed your heart. In one single day, pride can cause a man to lose what it takes him seven years to gain.  
> “Be generous and magnanimous. Be the patron of the poor, the widow, and the orphan. Practice largesse. An old proverb tells us, ‘He is not foolish who gives first.’ But it should not be self-interest that prompts you in your giving. Be mindful of the lines we heard a minstrel sing the other day: ‘Be liberal, give largely. The more you give away, the more honor you will gain, and the richer you will be.’ …  
> “And since your father has spoken of knights, I will add that there is another tribute you should pay good men, and that is respect. Rise up when in the presence of a good man, and when you are on the road salute everyone. Do not jest or banter with the poor, and be humble in your dealings with both the great and the small. To all, show a smiling countenance and joyful mien. These things cost so little.  
> “Eat well, but do not drink too much wine. As for chess, be on your guard with this game, which has cost the life of many a knight. It has happened more than once that a game has had a disastrous ending, and it was in fact a great blow from a chess board, delivered by Charlemagne's son, that killed the charming Baudouinet, nephew of Ogier the Danish. All games, of course, do not end in such catastrophe; still, too often one loses his money and even his horses. Take care.  
> “As a general rule, my son, avoid the company of ruffians and evil men. One sees too many of them today, and it is not meet that men of lowly birth and of low ideals should sit with barons, or that the valet should sit at the table with his master.  
> “But do not think that the men of the people are all worthless - far from it!” his mother warns. “And you would be well advised to think upon their proverbs. They are both charming and full of truth. You are already eager for adventure. Remember, ‘The bird who tries to fly before it is fledged falls to the ground.’ Youth like to talk too much, but remember, ‘Wise silence is better than foolish talking.’ You love danger; think of this proverb, ‘He who goes too close to the fire to warm himself can get burned.’ Do not rush blindly into the lion's mouth.  
> “Do not imitate the lamb that plays with the wolf. Beware of traitors – you will find them everywhere. Do not accept fine promises from the first comer; remember ‘One bird in the hand is worth four in the bush.’ … Above all, remember that you are of good stock and, as another old proverb says, ‘The son of a cat ought to catch mice.’ Imitate your father in all things, and you will do well.”  
> The father then takes up the lesson: “Your mother has rightly quoted familiar sayings, but it is the prouder words that have sprung from the hearts of our poets that I would have you follow. ‘Death, rather than dishonor!’ was Roland's cry at Roncesvalles. This has been the cry of every Catholic baron, and will be yours also. You already know that "the pure heart does not - and cannot - lie." Remember what they said of Ogier: ‘He was a great man, brave and true, for he was pure of heart.’ This is the most beautiful funeral oration that any true knight could desire.  
> “Remember, my son, that the knight has models in Heaven. It was St. Michael who overcame those vassals of God who revolted against the Sovereign Lord. St. George, St. Dominic, St. Maurice and his companions left the gardens of Paradise to come and fight with our knights here below. It is they whom you must imitate.  
> “Your mother has high aspirations for you. I am more moderate, and propose only human models to you: Roland, certainly, but also Oliver, and also the rough Guillaume, who fought a valiant fight for the Christian race and died a monk at Gellone; or the youthful Vivien, who fell on the field of battle at Aliscans, and whose soul Angels came down from Heaven to transport … and all the other great heroes of the Christian world. I give you, then, Charlemagne, Oliver, Roland and Godfrey de Bouillon.  
> “I will not hide from you that I prefer Godfrey de Bouillon. I think that he resembles Oliver as well as Roland, but with a greater degree of piety. He was as gentle as he was brave, and throughout the Crusade he always distinguished himself by a singular moderation, which, however, never permitted his courage to be questioned. ‘There goes the Duke Godfrey,’ the Crusaders would say, as he passed by, ‘who has the heart of a lion.’ You already know the reply he made to those who wanted him to wear the crown after the capture of Jerusalem: ‘God forbid that I should wear a crown of gold in the place where Our Lord Jesus Christ wore a crown of thorns.” The world has never seen a greater Crusader than he.  
> “You could take as your example a cousin of Girart de Roussillon, called Fouquie - the minstrels were singing to us about him only the other day. ‘Fouquie was heroic, courteous, frank, good, and a proficient speaker,’ they sang. He was a skilled hunter in the forest and marsh; he knew chess, backgammon, and dice. His purse was never closed to anyone who asked from it. Good or bad, all shared in his generosity and he was never slow to bestow largesse. He was supremely pious, for never in his life was he in a court where an act of injustice was proposed or committed without his energetic efforts to prevent it.  
> “He always fought for the better purpose; he loved peace and detested war. Yet, when he had his helmet laced, his shield around his neck and his sword by his side, he was proud, valiant, impetuous, superb, merciless and pitiless. When pressed by a crowd of armed men, he showed himself the firmest and bravest. He never yielded an inch, and there was not a man on earth daring enough to contend with him. He always loved brave knights and honored the poor as well as the rich. All, powerful or weak, found in him their support. Yes, my son, you may well take him for your model!”  
> “Yes there is your model!” the boy’s mother agreed. “Now, my dear child, do not forget that all the lessons of your mother and father can be said in a few words: Do your duty, come what may. The rest matters but little.”  

Just as the knights were nourished and strengthened by the body and blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ in the most Holy Eucharist, we too must have recourse to the sacraments that we might uphold the ideals of the knighthood.

There is a wonderful medieval tale called Sir Hugh of Tabarie in which Sir Hugh is captured by King Saladin—more accurately known as Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub—who was a Muslim ruler. In the tale, King Saladin asks Sir Hugh to make him a knight. Here is a snippet of the story:
> When they were entered into the pavilion, the Emperor Saladin sought to know of Sir Hugh in what fashion a man was made knight of the Christian chivalry, and required of him that he should show it to his eyes.  
> “Sire, whom then should I dub knight?”  
> “Myself,” answered the King.  
> “Sire, God forbid that I should be so false as to confer so high a gift and so fair a lordship even upon the body of so mighty a prince as you.”  
> “But wherefore?” said the King.  
> “For reason, sire, that your body is but an empty vessel.”  
> “Empty of what, Sir Hugh?”  
> “Sire, of Christianity and of baptism.”

Boys and young men, we have the sacraments. Thanks to Archbishop Lefebvre we have the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. The graces are here. We shall fight for the Kingship of Christ. Start by loving your family.

> "This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends."
> — *John 15:12-13*
