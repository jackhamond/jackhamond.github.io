The automation runs every night at 2200; it works great, but every now and again I need to turn Wi-Fi back on to do something. Thankfully when I am done with whatever it was that I needed Wi-Fi for, I can just tap the shortcut and it takes care of everything for me.”

# Preserve Testosterone App Icon

A few months ago I used the Shortcuts app on my iphone to make a shortcut and automation that automatically turn of Wi-Fi, cellular data, and bluetooth, and turn airplane mode on. The automation runs every night at 2200; it works great, but every now and again I need to turn Wi-Fi back on to do something. Thankfully when I am done with whatever it was that I needed Wi-Fi for, I can just tap the shortcut and it takes care of everything for me. 

I thought I would share the app icon that I use for the shortcut which I have named "Preserve T" on my phone.
